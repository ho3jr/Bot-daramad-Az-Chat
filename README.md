# The bot earns money from chatting in Telegram!
The function of this robot is that it can create a transaction between the owner and the members of the group. In this robot, each message is equivalent to one toman, which is registered in the database immediately after the user's message.

Instead of buying advertisements from Telegram and channels, you can give the same money to your members. By using this strategy, a good interaction between users and owners can be established. This strategy will encourage your members to be more active. 
You can use this method to make your Telegram group bigger. Even in the future, you can connect your group to a channel so that you can have more comments and views for your channel.
